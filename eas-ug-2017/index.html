					<p>The fight for freedom on the Internet</p>
					<p>@sprusr - spru.sr</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>In the context of computing, the Internet is classed as something of a ‘traditional’ technology these days. For much of the world, it simply exists, in the same way that electricity or cars do - we rarely consider that less than 50 years ago, the web hadn’t even been invented. But while most of its users continue to take it for granted, a war is waging over its future. Accusations, and proof of governments abusing their powers to spy on citizens have sparked protests and widespread anger, and left technologists questioning how safe they are online.</p>
						<p>In response to this, the phrase “nothing to hide, nothing to fear” is often used. But this mass-collection of sensitive data goes far beyond combating crime. Facebook is already a prime example of social profiling, where everything you say and do is analysed and used to serve finely target ads to its users. Google have built an empire on exactly the same principles, providing their products to anybody willing to surrender their personal data. We are constantly being used by technology, and manipulated by adverts without even realising.</p>
						<p>The Internet is changing. What was once a freedom ground for information and sharing has become a centralised network, where information flows between just a few of the large companies. The Internet needs to remain free as in freedom, and so I’ll discuss the ways we can protect ourselves online, through encryption and beginning to use decentralised networks such as Tor and Bitcoin.</p>
